\title{Lazy Load or Build Objects with Optional Caching}
\usage{
lazyObject(
  obj_names,
  fnRdat = NULL,
  builder = NULL,
  assign_env = parent.frame(),
  unpack_list = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj_names}{A character vector of object names to check and/or load into the environment.}

\item{builder}{A function that creates the desired object(s). If \code{unpack_list = TRUE},
it must return a named list.}

\item{assign_env}{The environment in which to assign the created or loaded objects.
Defaults to \code{parent.frame()}.}

\item{unpack_list}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the result of \code{builder()} is assumed to be
a named list and each element is assigned individually. If \code{FALSE}, the entire
result is assigned to the first name in \code{obj_names}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, messages will be printed describing what the function is doing.}

\item{file}{Optional character string giving the path to an \code{.RData} file used for caching.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the built or loaded object (or list of objects), but primarily
used for its side effect of assigning objects into the environment.
}
\description{
This function checks whether the specified object(s) already exist in the calling environment.
If not, it optionally loads them from an \code{.RData} file. If the file does not exist or does not
contain all requested objects, the function will call a user-supplied builder function to
create the object(s), assign them into the environment, and optionally save them to the file.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Case 1: Single object
lazyObject("my_data", file = "cache.RData", builder = function() rnorm(100))

# Case 2: Named list of multiple objects
lazyObject(
  obj_names = c("data1", "data2"),
  file = "multi_cache.RData",
  builder = list(data1 = head(iris), data2 = head(mtcars)),
  unpack_list = TRUE
)
}
